# Design

## A diagram of modules or classes that youâ€™ve decided to implement, in appropriate detail


## Advanced sketches of your UI that clearly explain which features are connected to which underlying part of the code

## A list of APIs and frameworks or plugins that you will be using to provide functionality in your app

d3-geo: For drawing a map
d3-hierarchy: For drawing the treemaps
d3-scale-chromatic: For using a scale for the chloropleth

## A list of data sources if you will get data from an external source

## A list of database tables and fields (and their types) if you will use a database

## If your application has multiple independent programs working together (e.g. a separate script to clean your dataset) you need to provide a high-level overview of these components and then provide a lower-level overview of the inner workings of each component.
